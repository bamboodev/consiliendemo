				<h2>Are your backups at risk?</h2>
				<p>
					Local backups should be a key part of your data protection strategy<!---->. They allow you
					to recover data and restore operations quickly in the event of a primary server outage,
					data deletion, or a ransomware attack. However, local backup alone isn't enough. What
					happens if the local backup device is destroyed or inaccessible due to a fire, flood, or
					other disaster? That's why you need a secondary, offsite copy of backups.
				</p>
				<!---->
				<!---->
				<h2>How can you reduce the risk?</h2>
				<p>
					<span>The first step is to talk to your IT service provider or MSP about Datto.</span>
					Datto's SIRIS business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) solutions could reduce
					<span>your</span>
					downtime to <strong>0hrs 36mins</strong>
					and <span>your</span> overall downtime cost would fall to <strong>$1,734</strong>. In the
					rare case that the first recovery attempt doesn't work, your costs would only increase by
					<strong>$241</strong>, as opposed to <strong>$34,668</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					With Datto, even if you are experiencing an outage at your workplace, work doesn't have to
					stop. Datto Continuity can get you back to business in a little as <strong
						>6 minutes</strong
					> on virtual servers, which can be accessed anywhere you have working internet. Features like
					Ransomware Detection and Advanced Backup Verification let you rest easy knowing your backups
					will work in your time of need.
